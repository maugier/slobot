# Here we declare the different networks we connect to. Should be self-explanatory
sockets:
    freenode:
        type: irc
        nick: SLoBot
        user: slobot
        real: "Jabber/IRC Bridge"
        server: irc.freenode.net
        password: your_password_here

        type: irc
        nick: SLoBot
        user: slobot
        real: "Jabber/IRC Bridge"

    jabber:
        type: xmpp

        password: your_password_here
        nick: SLB

    # This is a read-only source that reads from a named pipe. Useful to hook third-party notification gadgets
    fifo:
        type: fifo
        path: /tmp/ircfifo

    # This logs the messages to stdout
    console:
        type: console

# Here we declare which channels to bridge on which sockets. Again, self-explanatory.
# The fifo value is irrelevant, the console value is cosmetic only.
